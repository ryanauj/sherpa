# [Ascent Title]

## Overview

[Brief description of what the learner will build and why. 2-3 sentences. An ascent is a guided project that spans multiple routes, integrating skills as you climb toward a summit — a complete, working application.]

## The Summit

[Describe the finished application. What does it do? What does the user experience look like?]

## Prerequisites

Before starting this ascent, you should have completed or be comfortable with:
- **Required routes**: [List routes that must be completed first]
- **Helpful routes**: [Routes that enhance but aren't strictly required]

## Route Checkpoints

Each checkpoint corresponds to a route. Complete the route (or the relevant sections) then apply what you learned to the ascent project.

### Checkpoint 1: [Name] → Route: [route-name]

**What you'll learn**: [Brief description from the route]

**Apply to the project**:
- [Specific task applying route knowledge to the ascent project]
- [Another task]

**Milestone**: [What the project looks like after this checkpoint]

### Checkpoint 2: [Name] → Route: [route-name]

**What you'll learn**: [Brief description from the route]

**Apply to the project**:
- [Specific task]

**Milestone**: [What the project looks like after this checkpoint]

### Checkpoint 3: [Name] → Route: [route-name]

[Continue pattern...]
