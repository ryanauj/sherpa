# Guides

This directory contains quick reference guides for specific tasks and concepts. Guides are concise resources that help you accomplish specific goals or solve particular problems.

## Structure

- **best-practices/** - Best practice documents for various technologies and approaches
- **how-to/** - Step-by-step guides for specific tasks
- **troubleshooting/** - Problem-solving guides for common issues

## How to Use

1. Find a guide that addresses your current need
2. Follow the quick reference for immediate help
3. Read the detailed explanation for deeper understanding
4. Check common issues if something isn't working

## Creating a Guide

See the template in `/templates/guide-template.md` and refer to `/CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

## Difference from Tutorials

- **Guides** are reference materials for specific tasks (quick and focused)
- **Tutorials** are learning paths that teach broader concepts (comprehensive and sequential)

If you're learning a topic for the first time, start with a tutorial. If you need to accomplish a specific task, use a guide.
