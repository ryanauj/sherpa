# Tides: Collaborative Learning Tutorials & Guides

Welcome to **Tides** - a repository for hosting static tutorials and guides in markdown format. These resources are designed to be used collaboratively by both AI assistants and humans together (as tutor/guide and student), while remaining accessible to either separately.

## Vision

This repository aims to:
- Document efficient learning paths and processes
- Enable iteration and improvement of tutorials over time
- Provide clear, structured guides that both humans can understand and AI can effectively use
- Foster a community of learners sharing best practices

## Using the Tutorials

### For Human Learners
1. Browse the `tutorials/` or `guides/` directory
2. Choose a topic that interests you
3. Follow the markdown files in sequence (numbered or as indicated)
4. Complete exercises and practice problems
5. Use AI assistance when needed by referencing the tutorial

### For AI Assistants
These tutorials are structured to be AI-friendly:
- Clear learning objectives at the start
- Structured sections with consistent formatting
- Code examples with expected outputs
- Checkpoints for validation
- Context sections to help understand learner needs

### For Collaborative Learning (AI + Human)
1. Human selects a tutorial
2. AI acts as tutor/guide, explaining concepts
3. Human works through exercises with AI support
4. AI validates understanding and provides feedback
5. Both iterate on difficult concepts together

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on:
- Creating new tutorials

## Creating a Tutorial

Use the template in `templates/tutorial-template.md` to create new tutorials. Key elements:
- **Learning Objectives**: Clear goals
- **Prerequisites**: What learners should know
- **Structure**: Logical progression of concepts
- **Examples**: Practical, runnable code
- **Exercises**: Hands-on practice
- **Validation**: Checkpoints for understanding
