# Statistics Fundamentals - Route Map

## Overview

This route teaches the core building blocks of descriptive statistics: how to collect, summarize, visualize, and interpret data. You will work with real-world examples from sports analytics, casino gambling, finance, and data science so that every concept connects to practical decision-making.

## What You'll Learn

By following this route, you will:
- Classify data into categorical and numerical types and select appropriate analysis techniques for each
- Compute and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and choose the right one for a given context
- Calculate and explain measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation, IQR) to quantify variability in data
- Create histograms, box plots, and scatter plots that reveal patterns, outliers, and distributions
- Perform a complete exploratory data analysis on a real-world dataset and communicate your findings

## Prerequisites

Before starting this route:
- **Required**: Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, and square roots)
- **Required**: Comfort working with a calculator or spreadsheet
- **Helpful**: Any programming experience (Python examples are used throughout, but no prior Python knowledge is assumed)

## Route Structure

### 1. Types of Data
- Categorical data: nominal (no order) vs ordinal (ordered)
- Numerical data: discrete (countable) vs continuous (measurable)
- Recognizing data types in sports statistics, financial records, and ML feature sets
- Why data type determines which statistics and charts you can use

### 2. Measures of Central Tendency
- Mean: the arithmetic average and when it misleads
- Median: the middle value and why it resists outliers
- Mode: the most frequent value and its role with categorical data
- Real-world comparisons: average vs median income, points per game, stock returns

### 3. Measures of Spread
- Range: simplest measure of variability
- Variance and standard deviation: quantifying how far values deviate from the mean
- Interquartile range (IQR): spread of the middle 50%
- Applications: gambling variance, stock volatility, ML feature scaling

### 4. Data Visualization Basics
- Histograms: showing the shape of a distribution
- Box plots: summarizing spread, quartiles, and outliers at a glance
- Scatter plots: exploring relationships between two variables
- Choosing the right chart for the data and the question

### 5. Practice Project
- Analyze a sports season dataset end-to-end
- Compute summary statistics, build visualizations, and draw conclusions
- Identify which metrics best predict team success

## Learning Modes

This route supports three learning modes:

1. **Self-guided**: Read the guide.md file and work through exercises at your own pace
2. **AI-guided**: Work with an AI assistant using the sherpa.md teaching script
3. **Collaborative**: Read guide.md while getting help from AI following sherpa.md

## Tools & Techniques

This route references:
- **Python 3** with **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib** for computation and visualization
- **Spreadsheet software** (Google Sheets, Excel, or LibreOffice Calc) as an alternative for learners who prefer a non-code workflow

## Next Steps

After completing this route:
- **[Probability Fundamentals](/routes/probability-fundamentals/map.md)** -- Learn the rules of probability, conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem to reason about uncertain events
- **[Probability Distributions](/routes/probability-distributions/map.md)** -- Explore common distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson) and understand how they model real-world phenomena
- **[Regression and Modeling](/routes/regression-and-modeling/map.md)** -- Move from describing data to predicting outcomes with linear regression and basic modeling techniques
