# Git Basics - Route Map

## Overview

This route teaches the fundamentals of Git version control. Think of Git as a checkpoint system for your code - it lets you save "snapshots" of your work and go back to any previous state.

## What You'll Learn

By following this route, you will:
- Understand what version control is and why it matters
- Create and initialize Git repositories
- Track and commit changes to files
- View project history
- Master the basic Git workflow (modify → stage → commit)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this route:
- **Required**: Basic command line usage (cd, ls, pwd)
- **Required**: Text editor familiarity
- **Helpful**: Understanding of file systems and directories

2. **AI-guided**: Work with an AI assistant using the sherpa.md teaching script
3. **Collaborative**: Read guide.md while getting help from AI following sherpa.md

## Tools & Techniques

This route references:
- Git installation guides
- Command line basics
- Commit message best practices (see techniques/)

## Next Steps

After completing this route:
- **Git Branching** - Learn to work on features in isolation
- **Remote Repositories** - Share your work with GitHub/GitLab
- **Git Collaboration** - Work with others on the same project
